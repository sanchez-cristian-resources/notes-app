# Notes App built on Angular

### Technologies

This project was built with different technologies such as:
* Angular
* Angular Material

The project was also written on TypeScript. 


### Final Product

Based on the wireframes of the final product we've tried to make something that gets close to the wireframes.

### As a future feature...

 we would like to add a login page and a register page so that users can create an account and then login to the app. Also we would like to add a search bar so that users can search for notes.
